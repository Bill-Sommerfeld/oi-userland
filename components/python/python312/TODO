todo:
	walk through patches that apply, checking that they all remain relevant.

	walk through patches-todo, identifying which ones are still relevant.
		work out how to replace the setup.py patches that add modules
		(looks like patches to Setup.local?)
		-> PY_STDLIB_MOD()?

	01-setup:
		- disable references to /usr/local
			many of these scattered around.   search build logs.

		- readline library linked as: -Wl,-zrecord -lreadline -lncurses
			-> Modules/Setup??
			-> MODULE_READLINE_LDFLAGS from READLINE_LIBS from LIBREADLINE_LIBS ? (check configure.ac)

		- curses gets -DHAVE_NCURSESW=1, -D_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED=1
		- curses_panel gets /usr/gnu/lib/amd64
			-> fails to find -lpanel / -lpanelw in /usr/gnu/lib; configure.ac needs a patch

	get tests passing
		test_re failure

	get packaging details right

	build enough of the basics to try out some of my programs.

done:
	fix modules that aren't loading due to undefined symbols.
